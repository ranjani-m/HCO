# HCO
This repository contains resources for the classification and investigation of the heme-copper oxidoreductase (HCO) superfamily. It includes a sequence database of select protein sequences belonging to this superfamily from the IMG and NCBI databases, and structural models and Hidden Markov Models useful for the annotation of the HCO superfamily.
